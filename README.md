A totally useless application began very long time ago (perhaps 1st or 2nd year of highschool), in pascal, first as console app, then as GUI app.
Apparently, and as I hardly remember, in 2005 (as I see from the date modified of the .ico, 2005) (2nd year of highschool) I began writing it in c++, where I've also used hooks for the Font Dialog.
In 2009 I refactored and improved the app a little.

I also intendend to add features to it, but finally got demoralized due to the total lack of usefulness of the project.

The UI is in the Romanian language.
